The Opel Insignia (from Latin insigne = the emblem/coat of arms) is a midsize luxury car engineered and produced by the German automaker Opel. Production of the Insignia began in 2008 as a replacement for the Vectra and Signum.[1] The vehicle is sold under the Vauxhall marque in the United Kingdom, and known as the Buick Regal in China and North America.[2][3] It was launched in Australia and New Zealand under the Holden marque in 2015.[4]

In Chile, the vehicle was originally due to be marketed as the Chevrolet Vectra,[5] but is now sold as the Opel Insignia.[6] The Insignia made its debut in Australia in 2012, badged as an Opel.[7] but was dropped a year later after the brand was withdrawn from the market.[8] The Insignia is produced in Opel's plant in Rüsselsheim, Germany.
