The Opel Vectra is a large family car that was engineered and produced by the German automaker Opel. In the United Kingdom, the car was sold under the Vauxhall marque as the Vauxhall Cavalier and later as the Vauxhall Vectra, from 1995 onwards. It has also been sold by Holden in Australasia as Holden Vectra, and by Chevrolet in Latin America as the Chevrolet Vectra.

The Vectra was introduced in October 1988 as a replacement to the Opel Ascona, and itself was replaced in 2009 by the Opel Insignia, the nameplate spanning twenty one years and three generations of car.
